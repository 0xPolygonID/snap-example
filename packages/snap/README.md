# PolygonID snap example

Welcome to the `PolygonID snap example` repository! This repository serves as a demo project showcasing the usage of the `snap` library from 0xPolygonID for Verifiable Credentials and did:pkh.

## Overview

The `PolygonID snap example` repository demonstrates how to integrate and utilize the `snap` project to enable zero-knowledge proof sharing for Verifiable Credentials and did:pkh. With `snap`, you can enhance privacy and security in credential verification processes by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs.

This example project provides a clear starting point for understanding and experimenting with the capabilities of `snap` in the context of Verifiable Credentials and did:pkh. It showcases how to set up the project and utilize the library to perform zero-knowledge proof sharing.

## Features

- Demonstrates zero-knowledge proof sharing for Verifiable Credentials and did:pkh.
- Includes sample code showcasing the usage of `snap` in a practical scenario.
- Requires the installation of Metamask and Flask for a complete demonstration.

## Getting Started

To get started with the `PolygonID snap example` project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
    git clone https://github.com/0xPolygonID/snap-example.git

  ```

2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate into the project directory and install the required dependencies using Yarn or npm:

   ```

   cd snap-example
   yarn install

   ```

3. **Install Metamask Flask**: Install Metamask Flask, a browser extension wallet, to interact with the demo application. You can find installation instructions on the [Metamask website](https://metamask.io/flask/).

4. **Run the project**: Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project using the provided scripts:

   ```

   yarn start

   ```

   This command will start the application, and you can access it in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

5. **Explore the demo**: The project includes sample code and a guided demonstration of zero-knowledge proof sharing for Verifiable Credentials and did:pkh. Follow the instructions provided in the demo application to understand and experience the capabilities of `snap`.
